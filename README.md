# Wikilingua: A Multilingual Abstractive Dataset

This repo contains dataset introduced in the following paper: 

[WikiLingua: A New Benchmark Dataset for Multilingual Abstractive
Summarization](file:///Users/esindurmus/Downloads/multilingual_wikihow%20(48).pdf) 

We extract ~770k article and summary pairs in 18 languages from WikiHow. WikiHow is a high quality, collaborative resource of how-to guides on a diverse set of topics written by human authors. We create gold-standard article-summary alignments across languages by aligning the images that are used to describe each how-to step in an article.
